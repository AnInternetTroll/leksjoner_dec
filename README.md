## Info

This code was written with typescript and deno in mind primarely.
- `./src/` is where all the typescript source is.
- `./dist/` is where all the simplified vanilla JavaScript ESNext code gets compiled to.

## How to use

This homework was made to work with deno and the typescript compiler (and node after compilation), but there's some hoops.
To compile to node you run `npm run build`
If deno is installed all files should be executable with `./src/main.ts` for example
